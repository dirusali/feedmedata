<p>To ensure the full functionality of the website, The Best 5 or third parties commissioned by The Best 5 store so-called cookies on the client's device. The online stores listed on The Best 5 website may also use cookies, see their corresponding privacy policy.</p>

<p>A cookie is a small text file that is used, among other things, to collect information about the use of a website. These cookies do not contain any personal data, cannot be associated with any particular person and, unless otherwise stated, expire automatically after two years at the latest. Such data is not combined with other data sources.</p>

<p>Use of the website can also be made without cookies. From your browser you can deactivate the storage of cookies, limit it to certain websites or configure it in such a way that you are notified when cookies are sent. You can also delete cookies at any time via your browser.</p>

<p>The Best 5 informs in the following points about the use of cookies in particular cases. Third parties provide a link through which it is possible to block the cookie function (Opt-out). This block will be stored in a cookie, so you can cancel it at any time by deleting the cookies registered in your browser.</p>

<p>In order to surf the Internet and enable data transfer it is necessary that each device has a unique identification, called an IP address. The storage of this address, even for a short period of time, is technically necessary due to the operation of the Internet. The user's personal information associated with an IP, even if it is not abbreviated, can only be provided by the provider in specific cases if the competent authorities have requested it. The Best 5 informs in the following points about the specific modifications that are carried out in IP addresses. Upon registration, The Best 5 will store your IP address for the purpose of legally documenting your consent to receive your e-mails.</p>

<h2 class="tit3">The Best 5</h2>

<p>The cookies set by The Best 5 may be used to collect information regarding browser type and version, resolution, different page views, URL-Clickstream (the order of the pages you have visited among those we offer on the Internet), duration of visits to those pages, the internal reference of products or offers from your list of Favorites as well as the cookie number. However, no personal data such as name, address or email address will be stored. The Best 5 cookies are stored for a maximum of two years and the reference to the list of Favorites only for 90 days, provided you do not delete them before.</p>

<h2 class="tit3">Google Analytics</h2>

<p>The Best 5 uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service from Google. Google Analytics also uses cookies that enable the analysis of website usage by users. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) is usually sent to a Google server in the United States where it is stored. The Best 5 has activated IP masking by adding the code "gat._anonymizeIp();" on the website, so that within EU member states or other states signatory to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, Google will previously cut your IP address (so-called IP masking). The full IP address is only sent in exceptional cases to a Google server in the United States where it is clipped. On behalf of The Best 5, Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for The Best 5 and providing other services relating to website or Internet usage.</p>

<p>Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Data that Google receives from third parties in connection with interest-based advertising (such as demographics, gender or taste) may also be stored in cookies. Google offers a browser add-on through which you can disable the collection of data by Google Analytics and the processing of such data by Google. The add-on can be found at tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB where you can download and install it at your own risk. More information about this add-on can be found at: <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/es/analytics/privacyoverview.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> https://www.google.com/intl/es/analytics/privacyoverview.html</a>.</p>

<h2 class="tit3">Google Conversion Tracking</h2>

<p>The Best 5 is a Google AdWords advertising client and uses its conversion tracking. Google sets a conversion tracking cookie when a user reaches The Best 5 website through an ad offered by Google. These cookies become invalid after 540 days and are not used for personal identification. Each AdWords customer receives a different cookie. Cookies cannot, therefore, be tracked through the websites of AdWords customers, in this case The Best 5. Conversion tracking cookie information is used to create conversion statistics for AdWords customers. However, AdWords customers do not obtain any personally identifiable information. Read more about Google's data protection at: https://www.google.com/policies/?hl=en. Users can turn off Google advertising in whole or in part (Opt-out) at:<a href="https://privacy.google.com/?hl=en#google-experience" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> https://privacy.google.com/?hl=en#google-experience</a>.</p>

<h2 class="tit3">Google Tag Manager pixel conversion management</h2>

<p>The Best 5 makes use of Google Tag Manager, a service of Google. Tags are markups of data elements. Google Tag Manager is a Tag Management system, through which third party conversion pixels mentioned in this privacy policy are uploaded to a website. The tag management tool (which also implements tags) is a cookie-free domain and does not collect any information that can identify the user. However, the tool requests the activation of other tags, and these other tags may collect data. The Google Tag Manager does not access this data. If users have disabled data collection at the domain or cookie level, they will not be affected by any of the tracking tags implemented with Google Tag Manager. More information is available at:<a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/tagmanager/faq.html y https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/" rel="nofollow"  target="_blank">https://www.google.com/intl/en/tagmanager/faq.html y https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a>.</p>

<p>If you access the Facebook conversion pixel through your browser, Facebook can recognize whether an ad was successful, for example, if it resulted in an online purchase. In this case, The Best 5 receives only statistical data from Facebook without reference to a specific person. The Best 5 can then analyse the effectiveness of its Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes. For more information, see Facebook's privacy policy: https://es-es.facebook.com/privacy/explanation If you are a Facebook user and wish to revoke your consent regarding the use of the conversion pixel click here:<a href="https://es-es.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://es-es.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads</a>.</p>
